# üìä Data Analytics Projects in Python

Welcome to the **Data Analytics Projects in Python** repository!  
This collection of beginner-to-intermediate level projects showcases practical applications of data analytics using Python and popular libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**.  

The aim is to solve real-world data problems by following a structured analytics workflow, from data collection to model evaluation and visualization.

## üì¶ Project Overview

This repository includes multiple projects covering different problem statements:

- **Customer Churn Prediction**
- **House Price Prediction**
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
- **Loan Prediction Analysis**

Each project comes with a dataset (CSV file) and a Python notebook implementing the complete workflow.

## üìù Workflow Followed in All Projects

For consistency and clarity, the following step-by-step process was followed across all projects:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Definition
Clearly define the objective of the project, understanding what business or analytical question needs to be answered.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
Load datasets from provided CSV files using **Pandas**.

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform a detailed examination of the data by:

Checking structure and types of data

Viewing basic descriptive statistics

Detecting missing values

Understanding distributions and relationships using visualizations such as:

Heatmaps

Countplots

Distribution plots

Pairplots

4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features to prepare clean, consistent data for model building.

python
Copy
Edit
data.isnull().sum()
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
Use Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding for categorical data and StandardScaler for scaling.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection and Engineering
Drop unnecessary columns and select or create relevant features that influence model outcomes.

python
Copy
Edit
data.drop(['Unwanted_Column'], axis=1, inplace=True)
6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection and Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, select appropriate ML models based on the problem type (classification or regression), and train the models.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
Assess model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report, or R¬≤ score depending on the type of problem.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
8Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
Visualize data patterns, model results, and correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

python
Copy
Edit
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True)
9Ô∏è‚É£ Model Tuning (Optional)
Optimize model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
